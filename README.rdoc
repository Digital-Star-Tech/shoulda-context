= shoulda-context

Shoulda's contexts make it easy to write understandable and maintainable tests for Test::Unit.
It's fully compatible with your existing tests in Test::Unit, and requires no retooling to use.

== Contexts

Stop killing your fingers with all of those underscores...  Name your tests with plain sentences!

  class UserTest < Test::Unit::TestCase
    context "A User instance" do
      setup do
        @user = User.find(:first)
      end

      should "return its full name" do
        assert_equal "John Doe", @user.full_name
      end

      context "with a profile" do
        setup do
          @user.profile = Profile.find(:first)
        end

        should "return true when sent #has_profile?" do
          assert @user.has_profile?
        end
      end
    end
  end

Produces the following test methods:

  "test: A User instance should return its full name."
  "test: A User instance with a profile should return true when sent #has_profile?."

So readable!

== Assertions

  assert_same_elements([:a, :b, :c], [:c, :a, :b])
  assert_contains(['a', '1'], /\d/)
  assert_contains(['a', '1'], 'a')
